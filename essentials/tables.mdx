In [this example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qpd-llPC-EPzuTwLfnguMnrQk0eclyqJ?usp=sharing), we'll use the Partitioning Service to extract the “Supplemental Income” table (shown below) from the 10k financial document  of 3M, and turn it into a pandas dataframe. 


```python table_demo.py
import aryn_sdk
from aryn_sdk.partition import partition_file, tables_to_pandas
import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO

file = open('my-document.pdf', 'rb')
aryn_api_key = 'YOUR-KEY-HERE'

## Make a call to the Aryn Partitioning Service (APS) 
## param extract_table_structure (boolean): extract tables and their structural content. default: False
## param use_ocr (boolean): extract text using an OCR model instead of extracting embedded text in PDF. default: False
## returns: JSON object with elements representing information inside the PDF
partitioned_file = partition_file(file, aryn_api_key, extract_table_structure=True, use_ocr=True)
```

If you inspect the partitioned_file variable, you'll notice that it's a large JSON object with details about all the components in the PDF (checkout [this page](./aps_output.md) to understand the schema of the returned JSON object in detail).  Below, we highlight  the ‘table' element that contains the information about the table in the page.

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```
